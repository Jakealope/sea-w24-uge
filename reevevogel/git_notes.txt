-for man(manual) in Git must put a “-“ to connect words
-init = creates new repository in current directory
-dont git init in clone project
-git status looks inside staging area (git st)
-git add + file name to add to staging area
-git rm —cached +file name to unstage
git commit -m +’file name’ adds id, message, timestamp, diff, signature
-green check nothing in staging area. no files untracked.
-red x is a dirty directory, files untracked in staging area
-use present tense when writing a message
-git log = look at commits (git status look at staging area)
-git ll = shows long info
-git la = shows all
.git = staging area and commits lives within
-rm .git to delete history
-git ci -m ‘file name’ = shortcut for git commit
-you init a repository once, add to staging area, commit, modify, stage, commit
-git blame + file name+ = shows who did what
-head label- always points to the most recent commit
-master label = given to the first branch (when you git init) (default)
branch = a label that points to a specific place and time
-head and master keep up with latest commit
git branch = adds label to current commit

-“git branch” command shows branch list
-"git checkout” + branch name changes active branch
-touch = to modify time without modifying content. also creates file.
-local repositories (not central) remotes connect
-git remote -v = checks for remotes
-remotes = a way to share with other developers (provides common location for multiple people. you must create an empty repository first on github
“-u" wires master computer branch to github master branch. tracking.
-git push = keeps everything up to date between computer and server
-pull request lets project manager know that work is ready to be reviewed. comments are provided. developers can make changes based on comments to get reviewed as well.
-to pull leave base at master, compare against the new branch for pull request.
-pull requests are a github thing, not a git thing.
-solo project git merge. team project pull request
